## Features

* Tells you what's out of date.
* Provides a link to the package's documentation so you can decide if you want the update.
* Kindly informs you if a dependency is not being used in your code.
* Works on your globally installed packages too, via `-g`.
* **Interactive Update** for less typing and fewer typos, via `-u`.
* Supports public and private [@scoped/packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/scoped-packages).
* Supports ES6-style [`import from`](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) syntax.
* Upgrades your modules using your installed version of npm, including the new `npm@3`, so dependencies go where you expect them.
* Works the public registry, [private registries](https://www.npmjs.com/onsite), and [Sinopia](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia).
* Avoids querying npm registries for packages with `private: true` in their package.json.
* Emoji in a command-line app, because command-line apps can be fun too.
